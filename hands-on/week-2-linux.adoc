= SEIS 615 Week 2 Project: Linux & Git
Jason Baker <bake2352@stthomas.edu>
3.0, 8/10/2021

== Overview
This week we will focus on becoming familiar with launching a Linux server and
working with some basic Linux and Git commands. We will use AWS to launch and host
the Linux server. AWS might seem a little confusing at this point. Don't worry, we
will gain much more hands-on experience with AWS throughout the course. The goal
is to get you comfortable working with the technology and not overwhelm you with
all the details.

Note: the hands-on projects we work on in class are not graded. This is an opportunity for you to practice and make mistakes without fear of impacting your grade.

== Requirements

You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this project. You should also
read the https://github.com/jasondbaker/infrastructure-class/blob/master/hands-on/git-hands-on.adoc[_Git Hands-on Guide_] and https://github.com/jasondbaker/infrastructure-class/blob/master/hands-on/linux-hands-on.adoc[_Linux Hands-on Guide_] before beginning this
exercise.


== The project

Let's get started!

=== Create GitHub repository
The first step in the project is to setup a Git repository on GitHub. We will use a special solution called GitHub Classroom for this course which automates the process of setting up student  repositories.

Here are the basic steps:

[start = 1]
  . Click on the following link to open Project 2 on the GitHub Classroom site: https://classroom.github.com/a/mAE_YJw3

[start = 2]
  . Click on the *Accept this assignment* button.

[start = 3]
  . GitHub Classroom will provide you with a URL (https) to access
  the assignment repository. Either copy this address to your clipboard or write it down
  somewhere. You will need to use this address to setup the repository on a
  Linux server.

.Example:
----
https://github.com/ustseis615/project-2-linux-git-jasondbaker
----

At this point your new repository to ready to use. The repository is currently
empty. We will put some content in there soon!

=== Launch Linux server

The second step in the project is to launch a Linux server using AWS EC2. The
server should have the following characteristics:

  * Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit (usually the first option listed)
  * Located in a U.S. region (us-east-1)
  * t2.micro instance type
  * SSMAccess role
  * All default instance settings (storage, vpc, security group, etc.)
  * Remove the default SSH security group rule.

We will use the Amazon Linux operating system extensively in this class. AWS provides two versions of this OS -- Amazon Linux 2 and Amazon Linux. I will expect you to consistently use Amazon Linux 2.

I've created a video showing you how to launch a linux EC2 instance. The video is
available at:

* https://youtu.be/OEQq-c0fM-c

Once you launch the new server, it may take a few minutes to provision.

=== Log into server

The next step is to log into the Linux server using AWS Session Manager. Again, review the server launch video if you don't remember how to use this service to create a terminal session on the server.

=== Working with Linux

If you've made it this far, congratulations! You've made it over the toughest
hurdle. By the end of this course, I promise you will be able to launch and
log into servers in your sleep.

You should be looking at a black terminal that looks something like this:

  sh-4.2$ 

Your terminal cursor is sitting at the shell prompt, waiting for you to type in
your first command. Remember the shell? It's a really cool program that lets you
start other programs and manage services on the Linux system. The rest of this
exercise will be spent working with the shell.

Note, when you are asked to type in command in the steps below, don't type in
the dollar-sign (`$`) character. This is just meant to represent the command
prompt. The actual commands are represented by the characters to the right of
the command prompt.

Let's start by asking the shell for some help. Type in:

  help

The shell provides you with a list of commands you can run along with posssible
command options.

Next, check out one of the pages in the built-in manual:

  man ls

A _man page_ will appear with information on how to use the `ls` command. This
command is used to list the contents of file directories. Either `space` through
the contents of the man page or hit `q` to exit.

Most of the core Linux commands have man pages available. But honestly, some of
these man pages are a bit hard to understand. Sometimes your best bet is to
search on Google if you are trying to figure out how to use a specific command.

Type in the command:

  cd ~

This command places you in your home directory.
Each user on the system has a separate home directory. Let's see where your
home directory is located:

  pwd

The response should be `/home/ssm-user`. The `pwd` command is handy to remember
if you ever forget what file directory you are currently located in. If you recall
from the _Linux Hands-on Guide_, this directory is also your current working
directory.

Type in:

  cd /

The `cd` command let's you change to a new working directory on the server. In
this case, we changed to the _root_ (`/`) directory. This is the parent of all
the other directories on the file system.

Type in:

  ls

The `ls` command lists the contents of the current directory. As you can see,
root directory contains many other directories. You will become familiar
with these directories over time.

The `ls` command provides a very basic directory listing. You need to supply
the command with some options if you want to see more detailed information.

Type in:

  ls -la

See how this command provides you much more detailed information about the
files and directories? You can use this detailed listing to see the owner, group,
and access control list settings for each file or directory. Do you see any
files listed? Remember, the first character in the access control list column
denotes whether a listed item is a file or a directory.

You may see a couple files with names like `.autorelabel`. How come you didn't
see this file when you typed in the `ls` command without any options? (Try to run
this command again to convince yourself.) Files names that start with a period
are called hidden files. These files won't appear on normal directory listings.

Type in:

  cd /var

Then, type in:

  ls

You will see a directory listing for the `/var` directory. Next, type in:

  ls ..

Huh. This directory listing looks the same as the earlier root directory listing.
When you use two periods (`..`) in a directory path that means you are referring
to the parent directory of the current directory. Just think of the two dots as
meaning the directory _above_ the current directory.

Now, type in:

  cd ~
  pwd

Whoa. We're back at our home directory again. The tilda character (`~`) is another
one of those handy little directory path shortcuts. It always refers to our
personal home directory. Keep in mind that since every user has their own home
directory, the tilda shortcut will refer to a unique directory for each logged-in
user.

Most students are used to navigating a file system by clicking a mouse in nested graphical folders. When they start using a command-line to navigate a file system, they sometimes get confused and lose track of their current position in the file system. Remember, you can always use the `pwd` command to quickly figure out what directory you are currently working in.

Let's make some changes to the file system. We can easily
make our own directories on the file system. Type:

  mkdir test

Now type:

  ls

Cool, there's our new `test` directory. Let's pretend we don't like that directory
name and delete it. Type:

  rmdir test

Now it's gone. How can you be sure? You should know how to check to see if the
directory still exists at this point. Go ahead and check.

Let's create another directory. Type in:

  mkdir documents

Next, change to the new directory:

  cd documents

Okay, let's create our first file in the `documents` directory. This is just an
empty file for training purposes. Type in:

  touch paper.txt

Check to see that the new file is in the directory. Now, go back to the previous
directory. Remember the double dot shortcut?

  cd ..

Okay, we don't like our `documents` directory any more. Let's blow it away.
Type in:

  rmdir documents

Uh oh. The shell didn't like that command because the directory isn't empty.
Let's change back into the documents directory. But this time don't type in
the full name of the directory. You can let shell auto-completion do the typing
for you. Type in the first couple characters of the directory name and then
hit the tab key:

  cd doc<tab>

You should use the `tab` auto-completion feature often. It saves typing and
makes working with the Linux file system much much easier. Tab is your friend.

Now, remove the file by typing:

  rm paper.txt

Did you try to use the `tab` key instead of typing in the whole file name?
Check to make sure the file was deleted from the directory.

Next, create a new file:

  touch file1

We like `file1` so much that we want to make a backup copy. Type:

  cp file1 file1-backup

Check to make sure the new backup copy was created. We don't really like the
name of that new file, so let's rename it. Type:

  mv file1-backup backup

Moving a file to the same directory and giving it a new name is basically the
same thing as renaming it. We could have moved it to a different directory if
we wanted.

Let's list all of the files in the current directory that start with the
letter `f`:

  ls f*

Using wildcard pattern matching in file commands is really useful if you want
the command to impact or filter a group of files. Now, go up one directory to
the parent directory (remember the double dot shortcut?)

We tried to remove the documents directory earlier when it had files in it.
Obviously that won't work again. However, we can use a more powerful command
to destroy the directory and vanquish its contents. Behold, the all powerful
remove command:

  rm -fr documents

Did you remember to use auto-completion when typing in `documents`? This command
and set of options forcibly removes the directory and its contents. It's a
dangerous command wielded by the mightiest Linux wizards. Okay, maybe that's a
bit of an exaggeration. Just be careful with it.

Check to make sure the `documents` directory is gone before proceeding.

Let's continue. Change to the directory `/var` and make a directory called
`test`.

Ugh. Permission denied. We created this darn Linux server and we paid for it. Shouldn't
we be able to do anything we want on it? You accessed the system using AWS Session Manager which logged you in as a special user called `ssm-user`. While this user can create and manage files in its home
directory, it cannot change files all across the system. At least it can't
as a normal user. The `ssm-user` is a member of the _root_ group, so it can
escalate its privileges to _super-user_ status when necessary. Let's try it:

  sudo mkdir test

Check to make sure the directory exists now. Using `sudo` we can execute commands
as a super-user. We can do anything we want now that we know this powerful new
command.

Go ahead and delete the `test` directory. Did you remember to use `sudo` before
the `rmdir` command? Check to make sure the directory is gone.

You might be asking yourself the question: why can we list the contents of the
`/var` directory but not make changes? That's because all users have read access
to the `/var` directory and the `ls` command is a read function. Only the _root_
users or those acting as a super-user can write changes to the directory.

Let's go back to our home directory:

  cd ~

Editing text files is a really common task on Linux systems because many of
the application configuration files are text files. We can create a text file
by using a text editor. Type in:

  nano myfile.conf

The shell starts up the `nano` text editor and places your terminal cursor
in the editing screen. Nano is a simple text-based word processor. Type in
a few lines of text. When you're done writing your novel, hit `ctrl-x` and
answer `y` to the prompt to save your work. Finally, hit `enter` to save the
text to the filename you specified.

Check to see that your file was saved in the directory. You can take a look
at the contents of your file by typing:

  cat myfile.conf

The `cat` command displays your text file content on the terminal screen. This
command works fine for displaying small text files. But if your file is hundreds
of lines long, the content will scroll down your terminal screen so fast that
you won't be able to easily read it. There's a better way to view larger text
files. Type in:

  less myfile.conf

The `less` command will page the display of a text file, allowing you to page
through the contents of the file using the space bar. Your text file is probably
too short to see the paging in action though. Hit `q` to quit out of the `less`
text viewer.

Hit the up-arrow key on your keyboard a few times until the commmand `nano myfile.conf`
appears next to your command prompt. Cool, huh? The up-arrow key allows you to
replay a previously run command. Linux maintains a list of all the commands you
have run since you logged into the server. This is called the command history.
It's a really useful feature if you have to re-run a complex command again.

Now, hit `ctrl-c`. This cancels whatever command is displayed on the command line.

Type in the following command to create a couple empty files in the directory:

  touch file1 file2 file3

Confirm that the files were created. Some commands, like `touch`. allow you to
specify multiple files as arguments. You will find that Linux commands have all
kinds of ways to make tasks more efficient like this.

Throughout this exercise we have been running commands and viewing results on
the terminal screen. The screen is the standard place for commands to output
results. It's known as the standard out (_stdout_). However, it's really useful
to output results to the file system sometimes. Type in:

  ls > listing.txt

Take a look at the directory listing now. You just created a new file. View
the contents of the `listing.txt` file. What do you see? Instead of sending
the output from the `ls` command to the screen we sent it to a text file.

Let's try another one. Type:

  cat myfile.conf > listing.txt

Take a look at the contents of the `listing.txt` file again. It looks like your
`myfile.conf` file now. It's like you made a copy of it. But what happened to
the previous content in the `listing.txt` file? When you redirect the output of
a command using the right angle-bracket character (`>`), the output overwrites
the existing file. Type this command in:

  cat myfile.conf >> listing.txt

Now look at the contents of the `listing.txt` file. You should see your original
content displayed twice. When you use two angle-bracket characters in the commmand
the output appends (or adds to) the file instead of overwriting it.

We redirected the output from a command to a text file. It's also possible to
redirect the input to a command. Typically we use a keyboard to provide input,
but sometimes it makes more sense to input a file to a command. For example,
how many words are in your new `listing.txt` file? Let's find out. Type in:

  wc -w < listing.txt

Did you get a number? This command inputs the `listing.txt` file into a
word count program called `wc`.

Type in the command:

  ls /usr/bin

The terminal screen probably scrolled quickly as filenames flashed by. The
`/usr/bin` directory holds quite a few files. It would be nice if we could
page through the contents of this directory. Well, we can. We can use a
special shell feature called _pipes_. In previous steps we redirected I/O
using the file system. Pipes allow us to redirect I/O between programs. We
can redirect the output from one program into another. Type in:

  ls /usr/bin | less

Now the directory listing is paged. Hit the `spacebar` to page through the
listing. The pipe, represented by a vertical bar character (`|`), takes the
output from the `ls` command and redirects it to the `less` command where
the resulting output is paged. Pipes are super powerful and used all the
time by savvy Linux operators.

Hit the `q` key to quit the paginated directory listing command.

=== Working with shell scripts
Now things are going to get interesting.

We've been manually typing in commands throughout this exercise. If we were
running a set of repetitive tasks, we would want to automate the process as
much as possible. The shell makes it really easy to automate tasks using
shell scripts. The shell provides many of the same features as a basic
procedural programming language. Let's write some code.

Type in this command:

  j=123
  echo $j

We just created a variable named `j` referencing the string `123`. The
`echo` command printed out the value of the variable. We had to use a
dollar sign (`$`) when referencing the variable in another command.

Next, type in:

  j=1+1
  echo $j

Is that what you expected? The shell just interprets the variable value
as a string. It's not going to do any sort of computation.

Typing in shell script commands on the command line is sort of pointless. We
want to be able to create scripts that we can run over-and-over. Let's create
our first shell script.

Use the `nano` editor to create a file named `myscript`. When the file is open
in the editor, type in the following lines of code:

  
  #!/bin/bash
  echo Hello $1


Now quit the editor and save your file. We can run our script by typing:

  ./myscript World

Er, what happened? Permission denied. Didn't we create this file? Why can't
we run it? We can't run the script file because we haven't set the execute
permission on the file. Type in:

  chmod u+x myscript

This modifies the file access control list to allow the owner of the file to
execute it. Let's try to run the command again. Hit the up-arrow key a couple
times until the `./myscript World` command is displayed and hit `enter`.

Hooray! Our first shell script. It's probably a bit underwhelming. No problem,
we'll make it a little more complex. The script took a single argument called
`World`. Any arguments provided to a shell script are represented as consecutively
numbered variables inside the script (`$1`, `$2`, etc). Pretty simple.

You might be wondering why we had to type the `./` characters before the name
of our script file. Try to type in the command without them:

  myscript World

Command not found. That seems a little weird. Aren't we currently in the directory where
the shell script is located? Well, that's just not how the shell works. When you
enter a command into the shell, it looks for the command in a predefined set of
directories on the server called your _PATH_. Since your script file isn't in your
special path, the shell reports it as not found. By typing in the `./` characters
before the command name you are basically forcing the shell to look for your
script in the current directory instead of the default path.

Create another file called `cleanup` using `nano`. In the file editor window
type:

  #!/bin/bash
  # My cleanup script
  mkdir archive
  mv file* archive

Exit the editor window and save the file. Change the permissions on the script
file so that you can execute it. Now run the command:

  ./cleanup

Take a look at the file directory listing. Notice the `archive` directory? List
the contents of that directory. The script automatically created a new directory
and moved three files into it. Anything you can do manually at a command prompt
can be automated using a shell script.

Let's create one more shell script. Use `nano` to create a script called `namelist`.
Here is content of the script:

  #!/bin/bash
  # for-loop test script
  names='Jason John Jane'
  for i in $names
  do
    echo Hello $i
  done

Change the permissions on the script file so that you can execute it. Run the command:

  ./namelist

The script will loop through a set of names stored in a variable displaying each one.
Scripts support several programming constructs like for-loops, do-while loops, and
if-then-else. These building blocks allow you to create fairly complex scripts for
automating tasks.

=== Installing packages and services
We're nearing the end of this exercise. But before we finish, let's install some
new software packages on our server. The first thing we should do is make sure
all the current packages installed on our Linux server are up-to-date. Type in:

  sudo yum update -y

This is one of those really powerful commands that requires `sudo` access. The
system will review the currently installed packages and go out to the Internet
and download appropriate updates.

Next, let's install an Apache webserver on our system. Type in:

  sudo yum install httpd -y

Bam! You probably never knew that installing a webserver was so easy. We're not
going to actually use the webserver in this exercise, but we will in future assignments.

We installed the webserver, but is it actually running? Let's check. Type in:

  sudo service httpd status

Nope, you should see a response like `Active: inactive (dead)`. Let's start it. Type:

  sudo service httpd start

Now try running the `sudo service httpd status` command again to see if the service is running.

We can use the `service` command to control the services running on the system.
Let's setup the service so that it automatically starts when the system boots up.
Type in:

  sudo chkconfig httpd on

Cool. We installed the Apache webserver on our system, but what other programs
are currently running? We can use the `ps` command to find out. Type in:

  ps -ax

Lots of processes are running on our system. We can even look at the overall
performance of our system using the `top` command. Let's try that now. Type in:

  top

The display might seem a little overwhelming at first. You should see lots of
performance information displayed including the cpu usage, free memory, and a
list of running tasks.

We're almost across the finish line. Let's make sure all of our valuable work
is stored in a git repository. First we need to install git. Type in the command:

  sudo yum install git -y

=== Check your work
It's very important to check your work before submitting it for grading. A misspelled, misplaced or missing file will cost you points. This may seem harsh, but the reality is that these sorts of mistakes have consequences in the real world. For example, a server instance could fail to launch properly and impact customers because a single required file is missing.

Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:

====
&#x2523;archive +
&#x2503;&#160;&#160;&#x2523; file1 +
&#x2503;&#160;&#160;&#x2523; file2 +
&#x2503;&#160;&#160;&#x2517; file3 +
&#x2523; namelist +
&#x2517; myfile.conf +
====

=== Saving our work in the git repository
Next, make sure you are still in your home directory (`/home/ssm-user`). We will
install the git repository you created at the beginning of this exercise. You
will need to modify this command by typing in the GitHub repository URL you
copied earlier.

  git clone <your GitHub URL here>.git

.Example:
----
git clone https://github.com/seis615/project-2-linux-git-jasondbaker.git
----

The git application will ask you for your GitHub username and password. Note, the password you provide must be a GitHub personal access token and not the password you use to log into your GitHub account. Please review the video from earlier in the course explaining how to create a GitHub personal access token.

Git will clone (copy) the repository from GitHub to your Linux server. Since
the repository is empty the clone happens almost instantly. Check to make
sure that a sub-directory called `project-2-linux-git-<username>` exists in the
current directory (where <username> is your GitHub account name). Git automatically created this directory as part of the
cloning process.

Change to the `project-2-linux-git-<username>` directory and type:

  ls -la

Notice the `.git` hidden directory? This is where git actually stores all of
the file changes in your repository. Nothing is actually in your repository yet.

Change back to the parent directory (`cd ..`). Next, let's move some of our
files into the repository. Type:

  mv archive project-2-linux-git-<username>
  mv namelist project-2-linux-git-<username>
  mv myfile.conf project-2-linux-git-<username>

Hopefully you remembered to use the auto-complete function to reduce some of that
typing. Change to the `project-2-linux-git-<username>` directory and list the directory
contents. Your files are in the repository working directory, but are not actually
stored in the repository because they haven't been committed yet.

Type in:

  git status

You should see a list of untracked files. Let's tell git that we want these files
tracked. Type in:

  git add *

Now type in the `git status` command again. Notice how all the files
are now being tracked and are ready to be committed. These files are in the
git staging area. We'll commit them to the repository next. Type:

  git commit -m 'project 2 files'

Next, take a look at the commit log. Type:

  git log

You should see your commit listed along with an assigned hash (long string of
  random-looking characters).

Finally, let's save the repository to our GitHub account. Type in:

  git push origin master

The git client will ask you for your GitHub username and password (personal access token) before pushing the repository.

Go back to the GitHub.com website and login if you have been logged out. Click
on the repository link for the project. Do you see your files listed
there? Congratulations, you completed the exercise!

.Example:
----
Your repository link should be something like https://github.com/ustseis615/project-2-linux-git-jasondbaker
----

=== Extra Super Fly task (optional)

Write a shell script which outputs the public IP address of the EC2 instance by using the `aws` command-line application. This python-based helper application is installed on all Amazon Linux instances and can be used to access the AWS API. You will need to provide the `aws` command with a set of AWS credentials (see: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html). 

Hint: Check out the `aws ec2 describe-instances` command. 

Bonus points for outputing the IP address using jq (`yum install jq`).


=== Terminate server

The last step is to terminate your Linux instance. AWS will bill you for every
hour the instance is running. The cost is nominal, but there's no need to rack
up unnecessary charges.

Here are the steps to terminate your instance:

  1. Log into your AWS account and click on the EC2 dashboard.
  2. Click the `Instances` menu item.
  3. Select your server in the instances table.
  4. Click on the `Actions` drop down menu above the instances table.
  5. Select the `Instance State` menu option
  6. Click on the `Terminate` action.

Your Linux instance will shutdown and disappear in a few minutes. The EC2 dashboard
will continue to display the instance on your instance listing for another day or so. However, the state
of the instance will be `terminated`.
