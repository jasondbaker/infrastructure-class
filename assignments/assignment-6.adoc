== Overview
During the last assignment, you built a highly available web application
deployment by manually configuring a VPC, RDS database, and an EC2 auto scaling
group. You probably figured out pretty quickly that this manual creation
process involves many different components and it's easy to make a mistake
during the configuration process.

You will use the Elastic Beanstalk service to deploy another scalable web application.
You will learn how Platform as a Service can greatly simplify certain types of
application deployments.

Elastic Beanstalk can greatly simplify an application deployment on AWS because
it takes care of much of the underlying infrastructure configuration. While the
service was originally designed for application developers with limited AWS
knowledge, it's really a valuable service for any AWS user. As IT professionals,
our goal is to build scalable, secure, and reliable IT services. A service
architecture built around a Platform as a Service allows us to achieve these
goals with greater repeatability and consistency.

== Requirements

You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment.

== The assignment

It's time to launch some services using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS).

=== Launch management instance

We're going to take a different approach to creating AWS resources in this assignment. Until this 
point in the course, you have been working primarily with the AWS web console to create resources. 
In the real world we try to use web consoles as little as possible. Our preference is to define 
infrastructure as code rather than using point-and-click interfaces.

Why is this the case? The Elastic Beanstalk (EB) service provides a great example of why 
infrastructure as code is a preferred practice. AWS constantly updates and changes the web 
interface for the EB service. If you documented the web-based process for deploying an 
application on EB, you would have to update your documentation a couple times a year. 
Additionally, some EB users will see updates to the EB web console before other users. Good luck 
trying to keep all your team members happy.

The bottom line is that a code-based approach is easier to document, automate, and run. It is a much 
more scalable and reliable approach to building infrastructure. Let's start practicing what we 
preach.

Go ahead and create a new Amazon Linux 2 t2.micro linux instance called `mgmt1` in a default VPC in the 
us-east-1 (N. Virginia) region. Yes, you can use the AWS console for this task (but this is the 
last time!). You will also need to define an instance role for `mgmt1` with the following policies attached:

	* PowerUserAccess
	* AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore

[NOTE]
If you accidentally deleted the default VPC in the us-east-1 region you can create a new Default VPC in the VPC web console.

=== Setup EB CLI configuration

Connect to the instance via AWS Session Manager once it is available and install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI. The EB CLI is a command-line tool you can use to control the AWS EB service. It's kind of like a 
service-specific version of the AWS CLI. 

First we need to install an EB CLI installer repository:

  sudo yum install git -y
  git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup.git
  
Next, we need to install some software build tools required by the EB CLI:

  sudo yum group install "Development Tools" -y
  sudo yum install \
    zlib-devel openssl-devel ncurses-devel libffi-devel \
    sqlite-devel.x86_64 readline-devel.x86_64 bzip2-devel.x86_64 -y
    
Next, install a Python environment for the EB CLI and modify the shell execution path to use the new Python environment:

  ./aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup/scripts/bundled_installer
  echo 'export PATH="/home/ssm-user/.ebcli-virtual-env/executables:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
  p=(/home/ssm-user/.pyenv/versions/3*/bin); echo "export PATH=$p:$PATH" >> /home/ssm-user/.bash_profile  && source /home/ssm-user/.bash_profile
  
Finally, run the EB CLI installer application:

  python aws-elastic-beanstalk-cli-setup/scripts/ebcli_installer.py
  
You should be able to run the EB CLI now. Try running the command:

  eb --version
  
The command should respond with something like:

  EB CLI 3.19.1 (Python 3.7.2)

Next, clone the following Wordpress application git repository to the instance and change to 
the `seis615-wordpress` directory:

  git clone https://github.com/jasondbaker/seis615-wordpress.git

Inside the `seis615-wordpress` directory, run the `eb init` command:

  eb init

First, the EB CLI prompts you to select a region. Type the number that corresponds to the region 
that you would like to use and press Enter.

	us-east-1 (N. Virginia)

An application in Elastic Beanstalk is a resource that contains a set of application versions 
(source), environments, and saved configurations that are associated with a single web application. 
Each time you deploy your source code to Elastic Beanstalk using the EB CLI, a new application 
version is created.

The default application name is the name of the folder in which you ran `eb init`. Let’s set this 
to `wordpress`:

	Application name: wordpress

Next, the EB CLI should automatically detect that our application is using `PHP`. It will ask us 
what version of PHP our application needs. The PHP platform version we want is `7.4`.

We don’t need to use CodeCommit for this project, choose `no` when prompted.

We also don’t need to connect to the instances created by EB, so choose `no` when asked to setup SSH.

Notice how the EB CLI setup a hidden subdirectory called `.elasticbeanstalk` within the current 
directory. The settings you just entered are stored in a YAML file within this subdirectory. Check 
it out:

	cat .elasticbeanstalk/config.yml

=== Launch Wordpress environment

Now we need to create a new environment which will support our application. An environment consists 
of all the AWS resources needed to power the app -- EC2 instances, ELB, RDS database, auto-scaling 
group, security groups, etc. Launch the environment by running the command:

	eb create wordpress-dev --database --scale 2 --timeout 30

This command will ask a series of questions before launching the environment:

	RDS DB username: wpadmin
	RDS DB master password: (choose one)

The EB CLI will automatically upload the Wordpress application to EB as a deployment package. Now 
watch as the EB service builds the infrastructure environment for your application. This process 
may take about 20 minutes.

After the launch process completes, check out the status of your EB environment by using the 
following command:

	eb status

You should see something like:

	Environment details for: wordpress-dev
		Application name: wordpress
		Region: us-east-1
		Deployed Version: app-de0c-211030_175127
		Environment ID: e-dii3pnvzek
		Platform: arn:aws:elasticbeanstalk:us-east-1::platform/PHP 7.4 running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2/3.3.7
		Tier: WebServer-Standard-1.0
		CNAME: wordpress-dev.eba-mv2gjry3.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
		Updated: 2021-10-30 18:01:42.033000+00:00
		Status: Ready
		Health: Green

If the Status attribute is `Ready` and the Health is `Green` then you should be able to open up the 
Wordpress application in a browser using the CNAME address in the output above. For example:

	http://wordpress-dev.eba-mv2gjry3.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com

Go ahead and configure the Wordpress application like the previous assignment. Feel free to log 
into the Wordpress application and play around with the interface a little bit. For example, try to 
create a new blog post.

You just launched a highly-available Wordpress environment! What do you think? Was it easier to 
build the environment using the EB CLI and code versus using the AWS web console?

=== Modify the environment configuration

Go back to your terminal and check out the health of your deployed Wordpress environment:

	eb health

You should see two healthy instances. When we executed the `eb create` command we specified that 
the environment should launch with 2 instances (`--scale 2`). Let’s change the number of running 
instances in the environment to 1.

You can modify the EB application environment by typing in the following command:

	eb config

This will open up a text editor containing the current application environment configuration. Look 
for the `aws:autoscaling:asg:` configuration section and change the MinSize attribute to `1`.

Save your file changes and exit the text editor. Notice how EB immediately begins to modify the 
deployed application environment. Wait for the update to complete.

Now, try checking the health of the EB environment again. The health command output might still 
show two running instances. If so, wait a few more minutes and check again. EB will eventually 
terminate one of the running instances.

Terminate the deployed application by running the command:

	eb terminate --timeout 30

Watch as EB deletes all the infrastructure resources that were created to run your application.


=== Collect session data

Make a sub-directory in your home directory called `assignment6`. Change to that directory and
create a git repository.

Next, configure the AWS CLI with your access key, secret key, and the current region. Review the 
previous assignment if you don't recall how to configure the CLI.

Run the following command to retrieve the Elastic Beanstalk events and store the events in a JSON 
file:

  $ aws elasticbeanstalk describe-events --application-name wordpress --region us-east-1 > eb-events.json


=== Check your work

Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:

====
&#x2523; eb-events.json +
====

=== Save your work

Add the `eb-events.json` files to the Git staging area and commit the files to the repository.

Create a new GitHub Classroom repository by clicking on this link: https://classroom.github.com/a/NqIN8zXN

Configure your local Git repository to connect to this new GitHub repository. Push your work to 
GitHub and verify that the assignment files are located in the GitHub repository.

=== Terminate application environment

The last step in the assignment is to delete all the AWS resources you created. In this case, the 
only AWS resource still remaining is the `mgmt1` EC2 instance.

== Submitting your assignment
I will review your published work on GitHub after the homework due date.
