= SEIS 615 Assignment 2: Shell scripting
Jason Baker <bake2352@stthomas.edu>
3.0, 9/17/2021

== Overview
This week we launched a Linux server on AWS and worked with several basic
Linux and Git commands. We will expand on this week's learnings in this
assignment. Read through the entire assignment first before launching a
new server.

Automation is a critical component in modern IT services. Gone are the days
when IT professionals would carefully hand-craft IT solutions. Some enterprises
may still engage in these labor intensive practices, but more and more
organizations recognize the benefits of investing in automation.

Automation also aligns well with DevOps practices such as "infrastructure as code",
where infrastructure is created by writing code. You might feel a little nervous
about writing code, especially if you don't have a background in software development.
Don't worry. The level of code we write when automating infrastructure is
generally more basic than the code written for software applications. You just
need to get comfortable with a few simple practices.

You will notice that some of the tasks in this assignment are less prescriptive
than last week. In other words, instead of telling you exactly how to perform
a task, you will be expected to perform the task based on knowledge you gained
from the previous assignment. Try to perform a task without looking at previous
notes first. If you make a mistake, no worries. We all learn by making mistakes.

== Requirements

You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment. Optionally, you also may have read the _Git Hands-on Guide_ and _Linux Hands-on Guide_.

== A word about grading

One of the key DevOps practices we learn about in this class is the use of automation to increase the speed and repeatability of processes. Automation is utilized during the assignment grading process to assess your work.

It's important that you follow the instructions in each assignment and type in required files and resources with the proper names. All names are case sensitive, so a name like "Web1" is not the same as "web1". If you misspell a name, use the wrong case, or put a file in the wrong directory location you will lose points on your assignment. This is the easiest way to lose points, and also the most preventable. You should *always double-check your work* to make sure it accurately reflects the requirements specified in the assignment.

I will never ask you to submit an empty file -- in other words, a file with no content. If I ask you to run a command and store the output of a command in a file, I expect the file to contain meaningful information. You should always carefully review the content of your files before submitting your assignment.


== Setup a budget

We make every effort to stay within the AWS free tier when working on assignments in this class. Some of the projects will inevitably generate AWS fees though. Your AWS educational credit should be more than enough to cover these additional expenses. However, it's possible that you might generate excessive fees by making a mistake. For example, you might inadvertently launch a really large EC2 instance or you might launch a set of resources in a region, forget about them, and leave them running for several weeks.

These sorts of mistakes happen all the time in the real-world. Thankfully AWS offers a solution to this problem in the form of budgets. You can use the AWS Budget service to setup a monthly budget in your account to compare your current monthly spending to a desired amount. AWS will automatically notify you if the AWS monthly fees exceed your specified budget. Let's setup a monthly budget now.

Log into the AWS web console using your account, click on the Services link and select the AWS Budgets service.

Click on the `Create budget` button, select the `Cost budget` type, and click the `Next` button. Click the `Set your budget` button. Set up a Monthly budget starting this month with a fixed amount of $25. Give the budget a name of `Monthly Budget`. You do not need to change most of the default settings. Click the `Next` button.

Click the `Add alert threshold` button to create an alert based on the `Actual Costs` with an alert threshold of somewhere between 80-100% of the budgeted amount. Finally type in the e-mail address which will receive budget alerts, click on the `Next` button a couple times, review the budget settings and click the `Create budget` button to create the new budget.

Now you should have a budget alert setup to let you know if your monthly fees are exceeding a budget.


== The assignment

Ready? Let's go!

=== Launch Linux server

The first step in the assignment is to launch a Linux server using AWS EC2.
You should follow the same process as the class video and hands-on project in class. Refer back
to the class video if you need to review the launch process.

The server should have the following characteristics:

  * Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit (usually the first option listed)
  * Located in a U.S. region (us-east-1)
  * t2.micro instance type
  * SSMAccess role
  * All default instance settings (storage, vpm, security group, etc.)

[TIP]
.Taking a break
====
It's recommended that you complete this assignment in one sitting. But if
you need to work on it over the course of a couple days, that's no problem.
You can always `stop` your EC2 instance when you need to take a break, and
then `start` the instance back up when you are ready to work again.

The EC2 instances we are creating save our changes even when the instances are
shut down. Just don't `terminate` the instance until you fullly complete the assignment, because you will lose all of your work and have to start all over again.

AWS does not bill you for instances that are stopped. Well, technically they bill you for the storage costs of the instance while it's stopped, but that amounts to pennies per month.
====

=== Log into server
The next step is to log into the Linux server using AWS Session Manager. Again, watch the class video describing how to launch an EC2 instance if you don't remember how to do this.

=== More Shell Script Fun

Before we dive into the assignment, let's update the software packages on
the Linux instance by running a `yum update`:

  sudo yum update -y

Remember, it's a good practice to always update the Linux software packages
immediately after building the server. Amazon Linux is a _rolling_ release,
which means that the Linux image is being rebuilt with newer packages
several times a week. This means that when you launch an Amazon Linux
instance the software is usually up-to-date.

We will also use Git in this assignment, so install the required software
package:

  sudo yum install git -y

Let's access your home directory:

  cd ~

Verify your current directory location by using the command:

  pwd

You should see that you are currently in the `/home/ssm-user` directory.

Next, we're going to create a sub-directory in our home directory to store this
week's assignment files. Let's call it `project1`. Go ahead and create this
directory now, and change to the new directory.

Okay, you should be currently in the new directory. Let's create a new Git
repository in this directory using the `git init` command.

List the directory contents to verify that a `.git` directory exists. Remember,
the `.git` directory contains the actual Git repository. The directory starts
with a dot, so you can't see it if you just use the basic `ls` command. You also
need to supply some option flags to the `ls` command to view hidden files and
sub-directories.

Create a script file named `script1` and enter the following bash script
code into the file:

----
#!/bin/bash

# assign first command line argument
ARG1=${1}

# display first provided argument
echo $ARG1
----

You can use `nano` or whatever text editor you are comfortable with to create
the file. Remember, once you save the file you will need to make it
executable:

  chmod u+x script1

During the remainder of this assignment, when you are asked to create a
script file you will need to remember to make the script executable.

Now, let's run the script by supplying an argument:

  ./script1 foo

Notice that the response from the script is `foo`. The name of the script is
script1 and any terms we enter after the name of the script are called
arguments. We only provided one argument in this case, but we could provide a
whole list of arguments if we wanted. Arguments provide a method to input
data into a script. We can have the script perform different tasks based on
the data we input.

In the script code, the `ARG1` variable is assigned to a funny looking value
called `${1}`. This value represents the first argument listed after the command.
Technically, the command name is also treated like an argument. It's value is
represented by `${0}`. How do you think the second argument value is
represented? Right, using `${2}`.

Let's save our hard work by committing it to the Git repository.

  git add script1
  git commit -m "my script1 bash file"

Next, make a new script file called `script2` and enter the code:

----
#!/bin/bash

# assign the action
ACTION=${1:-launch}

# display first provided argument
if [ -z "$1" ]
	then
		echo "No argument supplied, default action is: $ACTION"
	else
		echo "Initiating $ACTION."
fi
----

Run the code without supplying an argument:

  ./script2

Did you get a permission denied error when trying to run the script? Hint: make sure it is executable.

Now, run the script again with an argument:

  ./script2 update

What happened here? A couple things are going on with this script. Note how
the `ACTION` variable assignment contains the strange looking `:-` operator.
This variable assignment basically says "assign the value of the first argument
to the variable ACTION, but if the argument doesn't exist then use `launch`
as the default value of the variable".

The if-then-else code structure performs an initial test `[ -z "$1" ]` which
checks to see if the first argument is an empty string. This
test evaluates as true if the first argument doesn't exist. Note, the spaces
in this code are very important. The bash interpreter will not understand
the code statement properly if the spaces are left out.

One of the key use-cases for this type of script code is building up a set of arguments
that can be used to control the execution of the script. When a user doesn't
provide a value for a required argument, sometimes a script needs to use
a default value instead.

Go ahead and add this file to the Git repository and make another Git commit.
Use an appropriate commit message during your commit.

Enter the `git log` command to verify that your local git repository now contains two commits.

Next, create a new script file called `script3`. The script code is a little
longer than previous scripts. Here is the code:

----
#!/bin/bash

# assign variables
ACTION=${1}

function display_help() {

cat << EOF
Usage: ${0} {-h|--help}

OPTIONS:
	-h | --help	Display the command help

Examples:
	Display help:
		$ ${0} -h

EOF
}

case "$ACTION" in
	-h|--help)
		display_help
		;;
	*)
	echo "Usage ${0} {-h}"
	exit 1
esac
----

Okay, take a break. There are several new concepts introduced in this script
file. First, notice the function definition for `display_help()`. We can use
functions in script files to encapsulate a set of code which we may want to
execute one or more times. You can build complex shell scripts by incrementally
adding functions. The function is called during the shell execution by
simply referring to the function name `display_help`.

When you execute the script, the bash interpreter skips over all the commands
encapsulated in the `display_help()` function definition (everything between
  the curly brackets). The interpreter won't execute the commands in the
  function definition until the function is actually called.

After skipping over the function definition, the interpreter reaches the
`case` statement. You probably learned in earlier programming classes that
a case statement provides an easy way to compare a variable to a set of
values. If the variable matches a value then the interpreter executes a
specified set of statements. The case statement block begins with the `case` command
and ends with the `esac` command (case spelled backwards).

In this case statement, if the `ACTION` variable matches the value `-h` *or*
the value `--help` (the or operator is signified by the vertical bar character `|`), the `display_help` function is called. Otherwise, if
the ACTION variable doesn't match anything (denoted by the `*` character),
a command usage statement is displayed to the user and the script exits. Note
that exiting a script with the value of 1 is the appropriate way to signify that
the script terminated improperly.

There's one more strange looking thing going on with this script. Look at the
`display_help` function code. What's up with this `cat << EOF` stuff? That's
just a trick which is used to output multiple text lines to the terminal. We are
redirecting the input to the `cat` command and inputing all the lines of text
between the two `EOF` tags.

Let's play with this script a little bit. Type:

  ./script3

Since you didn't provide any arguments the script helpfully displayed its
proper usage. The `case` statement didn't match the value of the first
argument to `-h` or `--help`, so it chose the default match (`*`).

Type this in:

  ./script3 -h

Now the script displays the help information for the command. The `case` statement
matched the argument value to `-h` and executed the `display_help` function. The
function displayed all the text between the two `EOF` tags on the terminal.
Easy!

You can now see how it's possible to build up increasingly complex bash scripts
by simply adding more argument options and related functions. That's exactly
what we're going to do next. Before we do that, add the `script3` file to the
Git repository and make another commit.

Wwe've been adding and modifying script files
in our Git repository on the default branch -- the *master* branch. Typically,
you don't want to edit and make changes to the files on the master branch. You
should do all of your coding and testing in a separate branch, usually a
feature branch. Once you have successfully modified your code then you can
merge it back into the master branch. A typical development workflow contains
many of these branching and merging activities. Let's start following that
practice now.

Note: in some cases the default branch on a Git repository may be called the `master` branch and in other cases it may be called the `main` branch. Git software typically uses `master`, while services like GitHub now call it `main`. So the name of the default branch in your repository will depend on where you first created the repo.

Start by creating a new branch:

  git checkout -b feature/script3

This is a nice shortcut command which creates a new branch called `feature/script3`
and immediately checks it out. If you type:

  git branch

You will see that the `feature/script3` branch is currently checked out (denoted by the highlighting and asterisk). Git
doesn't care about forward-slashes (`/`) in the branch name, and these are
commonly used to help categorize the purpose of the branch. In this case, we
are going to add more functionality to the `script3` file.

Modify the `script3` file so that it looks like this:

----
#!/bin/bash

# assign variables
ACTION=${1}

function create_file() {

touch "${1}-54321"
}

function display_help() {

cat << EOF
Usage: ${0} {-c|--create|-h|--help} <filename>

OPTIONS:
	-c | --create   Create a new file
	-h | --help	Display the command help

Examples:
	Create a new file:
		$ ${0} -c foo.txt

	Display help:
		$ ${0} -h

EOF
}

case "$ACTION" in
	-h|--help)
		display_help
		;;
	-c|--create)
		create_file "${2:-server}"
		;;
	*)
	echo "Usage ${0} {-c|-h}"
	exit 1
esac
----

Next, test out the script by running the command:

  ./script3 -c foo

List the contents of the current directory. You should see a new empty file
named `foo-54321`. Now, run the command again without providing a filename:

  ./script3 -c

You should see a file in the current directory named `server-54321`.

We expanded the bash script by adding a command that allows the user to
create a file. Adding the command required a couple basic steps:

  * Add the new command (`-c|--create`) to the `case` statement
  * Add a new function called `create_file`
  * Modify the displayed usage statement
  * Modify the `display_help` function to display information on the new option

One additional trick we are using in this script is passing the second
argument from the command line into the `create_file` function. This function
really works just like a command, so it can accept arguments as well.
The filename is passed as the second argument on the command line, but when
it is passed to the `create_file` function (`create file "${2:-server}"`) it
becomes the *first* argument in the function: `touch "${1}-54321"`.

Remove the `foo-54321` and `server-54321` files from the current directory.
If your script is working properly, go ahead and add it to the repository and
commit it.

Note, a shortcut to add all the files that have changed
in the current working directory to the repository is:

  git commit -a -m "script3 feature update"

Okay, let's add a bit more functionality to our script. We can use the script to
create new files but it would be nice if the script could also delete files.
Your mission is to modify `script3` to add this deletion feature. You should also allow the user to pass an argument that returns the version of the script. Here are the
requirements:

  * Create a variable called `version` with a value of `1.1.3`
  * The `-d` or `--delete` flags should execute the `delete_file` function.
  * The `delete_file` function should remove a specified file when provided a name: `<name>-54321`
  * If a filename isn't provided as an argument to the script, then use `server`
  as the default filename.
  * The `-v` or `--version` flags should output the version of the script (value of the `version` variable) using the `show_version` function.
  * The usage statement should display the new deletion flag and version flag options.
  * The help text should display useful information about the new deletion and version options.

You can test your script by issuing the following sequence of commands:

  ./script3 -c
  ./script3 -d
  ./script3 -c foo
  ./script3 -d foo

If your script is working properly, you should not see a `server-54321` or
`foo-54321` file listed in the current directory. If your script isn't working
properly, then keep working at it! It's okay (and expected) to make mistakes.
Feel free to use sites like Google or Stackoverflow to investigate any error messages that you
encounter.

Once the script is working properly, commit the updated script to your
current branch.

Next, checkout the master branch from the Git repository:

  git checkout master

Take a look at your `script3` file again:

  less script3

Whoa! What happened to all of our script changes? All of our hard work is
gone! Well, no not really. We committed the changes to `script3` on a
different branch. When we switched back to the master branch we basically
stepped back in time. Git replaced the `script3` file with a version of the
file before we created our new branch.

Branching is one of the most powerful features of Git and other version control
systems. Branching allows you to experiment with ideas and code without
destroying previous versions of files. You can quickly branch your code to
test a new idea, and if it doesn't work you don't have to worry about breaking
your original code.

Switch back to the feature branch:

  git checkout feature/script3

Now, to calm you fears take a look at the script3 file:

  less script3

All your modified code is back! The key concept to understand is that
the files in your current working directory always represent a single point
in time in the Git repository (a commit). Git updates the files
in the current directory as you change branches. The lesson here is that you
always need to understand *where* you are in the repository, because this
directly effects which files and changes you see in the file directory.

Before we push our code up to GitHub, let's merge our feature branch into
the master branch. Think of this like merging our new feature into our
production code.

  git checkout master
  git merge feature/script3

Look at the contents of the `script3` file. Your changes from the feature
branch have now been merged into the master branch.

=== Check your work
Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:

====
&#x2523; script1 +
&#x2523; script2 +
&#x2517; script3 +
====

Note, all of these script files should be executable.

=== Push project repo to GitHub

The final step of the assignment is to push your repository up to GitHub. We'll
follow a slightly different process than we followed during the previous assignment.
Last time, we first created the Git repository on GitHub and then cloned (copied)
the repository to our Linux server. Once we finished working with the repository
on our local server, we pushed the changes back up to the GitHub repository.

That process works fine when you are working with a brand new project. But sometimes
you want to take an existing project and existing Git repository and connect it
to GitHub. That's what we will do now.

First, click on the following link to create a new repository for this assignment:

https://classroom.github.com/a/j6Eny6wo

GitHub Classroom will provide you with a URL (https) to access
the assignment repository. Either copy this address to your clipboard or write it down
somewhere.

.Example:
----
https://github.com/ustseis615/assignment-2-shell-scripting-jasondbaker
----

Next, you need to connect your local Git repository on the Linux server to
your GitHub repository. The way you do that is by specifying your GitHub
repository as the *origin*. A Git repository can be linked to several different
Git repositories, called *remotes*. It's not uncommon for a typical repository
to have at least two or three different remotes. In this case, all we care
about is the remote called origin. Setup the origin remote by typing:

  git remote add origin <your GitHub repo URL>.git


.Example:
----
git remote add origin https://github.com/ustseis615/assignment-2-shell-scripting-jasondbaker.git
----

Now push your local repository to the GitHub repo by typing:

  git push -u origin master

The `-u` flag in this command sets the _upstream_ server for the repository to
the remote defined as origin. Then, the master branch from the repository is
pushed to the GitHub account.

Congratulations, your work has now been pushed up to GitHub! Take a look at
your repository on GitHub and look specifically at the branches. You will see
that only the master branch exists on the GitHub repository. That's because
we specifically pushed up the master branch. If you type in `git branch` on
your Linux server, you will notice that your local repository has two branches:
`master` and `feature/script3`.

It's common for a local repository and upstream repository to have different
branches. When you have a team of developers all working against the same
GitHub repository, each team member may have various branches that exist on
their local workstations but not on the central GitHub repository. Of course,
it also makes sense to push these local branches to the GitHub repository at
times as well -- especially if multiple developers are collaborating on a
particular feature and need to share changes.

=== Terminate server

The last step in the assignment is to terminate your Linux instance. AWS will bill you for every
hour the instance is running. The cost is nominal, but there's no need to rack
up unnecessary charges. Refer to the previous assignment if you don't remember
how to terminate your EC2 instance.

== Submitting your assignment
You should have emailed me your GitHub username during the previous assignment.
There is no need to email your username again. I will review your published
work on GitHub after the homework due date.

Important note: Your assignment work each week must be submitted to the classroom repository before the assigned due date. If you make *any* changes to the repository after the due date whether purposely or accidentally, your assignment will be considered late and you will receive no credit. *Do not make modifications to your classroom repository after the assignment due date.*
