= SEIS 615 Assignment 10: Docker
Jason Baker <bake2352@stthomas.edu>
2.0, 08/10/2020

== Overview
Containers are revolutionizing the way we package and deploy applications. Traditionally, we would install applications on bare metal hardware or virtual machines in our computing environment. We would have to carefully place applications on infrastructure to minimize conflicting requirements such as different versions of shared libraries. Containers let us partition applications and related dependencies on a shared computing platform.

In this week's assignment, you will build a Docker container using a Dockerfile and a CI/CD infrastructure pipeline.

== Requirements

You need to have a personal AWS account and GitHub account for this assignment.

== The assignment

The assignment this week has many different components. It's not difficult if you break each of these components down into smaller tasks, but you will have to carefully read these requirements as you work on the assignment. Give yourself plenty of time to work on the assignment this week. Let's start shipping those containers!

=== GitHub repository

Start by creating your private GitHub repository for this assignment:

  https://classroom.github.com/a/75ftVGmc

You will need to setup a personal access token in your GitHub account and store this token in a safe place. Later on in the assignment you will provide this token to CodePipeline so that it can download the application source code from your classroom GitHub repository.

=== Build Image Pipeline

It is a common practice to automate the building of Docker images using a CI/CD pipeline. 
Your pipeline will utilize four services: GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and Elastic Container Registry (ECR). You will create a Docker container using a Python application, `Dockerfile` and `buildspec.yml` file stored in your classroom GitHub repository. 

You will start by building a pipeline in CodePipeline which contains two stages. The first stage will pull the source code files from your GitHub repository.

The second stage will use CodeBuild to setup an application build environment, get a login credential from ECR, lint the Python application, build a Docker container, and push the Docker container to ECR. Whew, that sounds like a lot of work but each of these tasks only requires one or two commands. 

We've learned by now that we don't want to build the pipeline resources manually. Create a new CloudFormation template called `docker-build-template.yaml` containing all of the AWS resources needed to create the Docker build pipeline. You may want to use the following CloudFormation template as a starting point for your template:

  https://s3.amazonaws.com/seis615/app-codepipeline-template.yaml

If you use this example template, note that we aren't going to use the AWS CodeDeploy service or any EC2 resources in this assignment so you can remove those resources from your version of the template. 

You also don't need to use most of the parameters defined in the example template. You will need to provide the CloudFormation stack with the GitHub repo location information. I recommend using the following parameters to store this information: GitHubBranchName and GitHubRepositoryName.

The pipeline will create a Docker image and push it into an ECR repository. Your template should create this ECR repository with a logical name of `DockerRepository` and RepositoryName of `classweb`. Additionally, the template will need to grant the CodeBuild service access to the new ECR repository so that it can push Docker images into it. You can enable this access by adding the following policy statements to the CodeBuild service role in the template:

----

    Effect: "Allow"
    Resource:
      - !GetAtt DockerRepository.Arn
    Action:
      - "ecr:GetRepositoryPolicy"
      - "ecr:ListImages"
      - "ecr:PutImage"
      - "ecr:UploadLayerPart"
      - "ecr:TagResource"
      - "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload"
      - "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload"
      - "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"
      - "ecr:DescribeImages"
      - "ecr:DescribeRepositories"
      - "ecr:BatchCheckLayerAvailability"
    Effect: "Allow"
    Resource:
      - "*"
    Action:
      - "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken"

----

CodeBuild creates the proper build environment for the Python project. It should use the `python: 3.9` runtime version (remember runtime versions are defined in a `buildspec.yml` file).

We need to provide CodeBuild with the ECR repository URI (it's DNS name location) in order for CodeBuild to tag and push new Docker images to it. How should we do this? Let's setup an environment variable in CodeBuild to inject this information into the build environment. Create an environment variable called `REPOSITORY_URI` with a value that looks like this format:

  <AWS account ID>.dkr.ecr.<AWS region>.amazonaws.com/classweb

The items in angle-brackets should be substituted with appropriate values in your environment. Hard-coding these values in the template is strongly discouraged because the template should be portable (hint: use parameter substitution). For example, the resulting value string should look something like:

  914710628553.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/classweb

The CodeBuild build environment is running inside of a Docker container. Normally you can't build a Docker container when running a Docker build command inside of a container. This becomes a little mind-bending like the movie Inception. However, you can tell CodeBuild that you would like to do this by enabling `PrivilegedMode` in the CodeBuild environment.

When you eventually deploy your CloudFormation stack (we're getting a little ahead of ourselves here), you will need to setup GitHub credentials so that CodePipeline can access your private repository. Remember, when you click on the GitHub classroom link for this assignment a private repository is automatically created for you. While you may have access to this repository, AWS won't have access to it. 

Also, when you provide CodePipeline with your GitHub username and repository name you might make the mistake of using your standard GitHub username. However, remember that GitHub classroom creates repositories in the `ustseis615` organizational account and not your personal GitHub account. You may have access to the repository but you aren't the owner.

The GitHub username you will provide to CodePipeline is `ustseis615` and the GitHub repository name will look something like this: `assignment-10-docker-<username>`.

You can launch a CloudFormation stack after you finish editing the template. You won't be able to build anything yet until you add a couple more files to your repository.

=== Python web application

Let's setup a Python web application in our GitHub classroom repository. It's common to store our application source files and build pipeline files in the same repo. Create a simple Python web application file called `site.py` located in a sub-directory called `app` with the following contents (note: the spacing is important for linting purposes!):

----
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)


@app.route('/')
def root_page():
    return '<html><body><b>Working with containers is super fun!</b></body></html>'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=8080)
----

Create a Python requirements file called `requirements.txt` in the same directory as the `site.py` file with the following contents:

  Flask==1.1.1
  flake8==3.7.8

=== Build stages

The CodeBuild build stages are defined by a `buildspec.yml` file located at the root directory of your repository. You can create this file from scratch or you can start with an existing file and edit it. For example, you can take a look at the `buildspec.yml` file from a repository used in our lecture:

  https://github.com/ustseis615/python-project


The build process should have 4 phases: install, pre_build, build, and post_build. The required environment runtimes are configured in the install phase. This automatically installs the basic runtime dependencies needed during the build process.

Let's look at the requirements for each of the additional phases.

=== The pre_build phase

The pre_build phase should perform the following tasks:

  * Install the python application dependencies:

    pip install -r app/requirements.txt

  * Retrieve a login token for ECR. The Docker engine needs to have an access credential in order to push a new image into ECR -- which is basically a private Docker repository associated with your account. Use the following command to retrieve a login token:
  
  $(aws ecr get-login --region $AWS_DEFAULT_REGION --no-include-email)

  * Lint the Python script files in your repository using the flake8 linter. Remember that a linter performs static code analysis to validate the syntax and formatting of your code. It's really useful for quickly identifying common code errors and ensuring consistent coding standards across a team. Here is the command you should use to lint the Python application:

  flake8 app/*.py

If you encounter a linting error, fix the error in the `site.py` script file and attempt to run the pipeline again. 

=== The build phase

The build phase will use a Dockerfile and build command to create a new container image called `<ECR repository URI>` with a `latest` tag -- where the angle brackets are replaced with your actual ECR repository URI. The ECR repository URI is passed into the build environment using an environment variable named `REPOSITORY_URI`. Remember how we set that up in the CloudFormation template? You can use that environment variable in the Docker build command to tag the image properly.

Now in the real world we probably would give every image we build a unique tag -- like a semantic version number or a datestamp. We'll just take the easy route here and use the `latest` tag for each of our builds.

You will need to create a Dockerfile in your repository to define the Docker image build. Here are the configuration requirements for the Docker image:

  * The new image must be based off the `ghcr.io/ustseis615/ubuntu` image using the `xenial` version.
  * Set the maintainer of the image to your name and email address.
  * The image should expose port 8080.
  * Update the package repositories using `apt-get update`
  * Install the following software packages inside the container: `python-pip` and `python-dev` (remember this is an Ubuntu image so we use `apt-get` to install packages, not `yum`)
  * Copy the `site.py` and `requirements.txt` files into the `/app` directory in the container.
  * From the `/app` directory in the container, run the following pip command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  * When a container is created, Docker *must always* run the command `python`. Additionally, the container will use `site.py` as a default optional argument to the `python` command.

=== The post_build Stage

The post_build stage should push the new Docker image into ECR using the `docker push` command.


=== Testing your image

Congratulations! If you've gotten this far that means you were able to successfully publish a Docker image to ECR. How do you know if that image actually works properly? You can test it in a couple different ways.

If you have the Docker engine installed on your local Windows or Mac workstation, you could pull down the image from ECR and use it to run a container locally. The container is listening on port 8080 so you would need to open up a web browser and browse to `localhost:8080` or map it to port 80. You should see a response from the web application if the container is working properly.

Note that in order to pull down the image you will need to log into ECR first using the AWS CLI (which also means you must have access keys configured on your machine):

  $(aws ecr get-login --region us-east-1 --no-include-email)

Then pull down the Docker image:

  docker pull <ECR image URI>

Finally, launch a new docker container using this image:

  docker run -d -p 80:8080 --name classweb1 <ECR image URI>:latest

You could also launch an EC2 instance with the Docker engine installed on it, like the instance we used in class when learning Docker:

  https://s3.amazonaws.com/seis615/docker-single-server.yaml

Note that this instance doesn't have access to ECR in order to pull down the Docker image. You would need to modify the instance profile of the EC2 instance in order to allow ECR access using something like the `arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly` policy.


=== Check your work

Here is what the contents of your git repository should look like before final submission:

====
&#x2523; Dockerfile +
&#x2523; buildspec.yml +
&#x2523; docker-build-template.yaml +
&#x2517; /app +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2523; site.py +
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x2523; requirements.txt +

=== Terminate application environment

The last step in the assignment is to terminate your CloudFormation stack on AWS.

== Submitting your assignment
I will review your published work on GitHub after the homework due date.
